            <br/><strong>0900-0930 </strong><br/>
            <br/>There is a lot of investment going into software engineering at the moment due to the increasing reliance on mobile technology, venture capital-backed start-ups, the growing complexity of technology, and emerging industries. The demand for skilled and qualified software engineers seems to have no end. This demand is strengthened by a changing economic landscape and fueled by the need for technology solutions. With billions of physical devices around the world that are now connected to the internet and that are collecting and sharing data, all industries are quickly becoming technology driven industries.<br/>
                
            <br/><strong>0900-0930 </strong><br/>
            <br/>Software engineers have extensive knowledge of programming languages, software development, and computer operating systems, and they apply engineering principles to software creation. By applying these engineering principles to every stage of the development process, from requirements analysis to the software process, they can create customized systems for individual clients. Just as a civil engineer will make sure that a bridge has a solid foundation, a software engineer will also begin with a thorough study of requirements and work through the development process in a systematic way.<br/>
                
            <br/><strong>0900-0930 </strong><br/>
            <br/>Software engineers are highly sought after. Developers that live in high demand areas often receive many inquiries a month from recruiters and head hunters. A software engineer applies mathematical analysis and the principles of computer science in order to design and develop computer software.</p></span>
